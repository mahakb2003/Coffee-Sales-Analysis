# Coffee-Sales-Analysis

â˜• Coffee Business Data Analysis

Running a coffee business is exciting, but smart decisions require data. With thousands of transactions across multiple countries, this project analyzes coffee sales to answer key business questions like:

1.Who are the most valuable customers?
2.Which country contributes the most sales?
3.Which coffee type generates the highest revenue?
4.Which products bring the highest profit?
5.How do sales change over time?

Using Excel functions, data cleaning techniques, and an interactive dashboard, we turned raw data into actionable insights.

# Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on 3 key tables:

A.Orders Data â€“ Order ID, Date, Customer ID, Product ID, Quantity, Sales Amount, Country, Coffee & Roast Type, Loyalty Membership
B.Customers Data â€“ Customer Name, Contact Info, Address, Country, Loyalty Program
C.Products Data â€“ Product ID, Coffee Type, Roast Type, Size, Unit Price, Profit Margin

#Data Processing in Excel

1.Merged Data: Used XLOOKUP & INDEX MATCH to bring in customer and product details.
2.Cleaned Data: Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
3.Created Metrics: Calculated revenue per customer, sales per order, and profit margins.

# Key Insights

1.Top Customers: The top 5 customers contribute 15% of total revenue. Loyalty members tend to spend more.
2.By Country: USA leads with $35,638, followed by Ireland ($6,696) and the UK ($2,798).
3.Best Sellers: Arabica (Light Roast) is both the top-selling and most profitable. Larger packs (2.5 kg) drive higher revenue.
